# 100 days 100 websites

I will be coding web pages for 100 days starting May 26, 2019.

The rules are simple:

* Upload ~~before midnight~~ to a github repository everyday [100 days 100 websites](https://github.com/jailandrade/100days100websites)
* ~~ Upload a live demo using codepen~~
* ~~ Write a blog post about it at [my blog](https://jailandrade.rocks/blog), link the github commit and the codepen url~~
* Share on social networks
* Repeat ~~the first 3 steps for 100 days~~

## Disclaimer

I stop the challenge on June 21, 2019 ~~I have modified the rules to work without presure. But I will complete my 100 websites.~~

I resume the challenge on March 4, 2025
