# 100 days 100 websites

I will be coding web pages for 100 days starting May 26, 2019.

The rules are simple:

1. Upload before midnight to a github repository everyday [100 days 100 websites](https://github.com/jailandrade/100days100websites)
2. Upload a live demo using codepen
3. Write a blog post about it at [my blog](https://jailandrade.rocks/blog), link the github commit and the codepen url
4. Repeat the first 3 steps for 100 days
