# 100 days 100 websites

I will be coding web pages for 100 days starting May 26, 2019.

The rules are simple:

* Upload **before midnight** to a github repository everyday [100 days 100 websites](https://github.com/jailandrade/100days100websites)
* Post it to [La Casita del Markup](https://lacasitadelmarkup.com)
* Write a log post about it at [my log](https://jailandrade.com/log), link the github commit and the lcdm url
* Share it on social networks
* Repeat the first 3 steps for 100 days, or more days

## Disclaimer

I stop the challenge on June 21, 2019 I have modified the rules to work without presure. But I will complete my 100 websites.

I resume the challenge on **April 15, 2025**
